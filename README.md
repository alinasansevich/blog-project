# blog-project

This blog is a website where you can create articles, update or edit them and also delete them as well.
There will be a home page to display all the articles and when the users click an individual article, 
it will take them to another page where they can read more about that article.

I want to give the users the option of having their own online store through this app, so the blog's visitors
would be able to buy the user's products (if they were offering any), and pay through PayPal or Venmo? I'm still figuring this out.
